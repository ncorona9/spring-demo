	<h2>An Introduction:</h2>
<p>I am a 19 year <strong> Graphic Designer.</strong> I plan on having various skills under my belt, such as illustration, web designing, and video/audio editing. This is my second semester of college and I am looking forward to learning new things. My skills with coding are limited, but I am excited. I became interested in Digital Media due to the flexibility of the job. I have a range of hobbies. Drawing, playing video games, watching TV and anime, and video editing are just <em>some</em> of these hobbies.
